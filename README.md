# Multi-page website for event agency "Magic Art Studio"
[link to web-site](https://magic-artstudio.com/) 

The main idea was to create bright and attractive web-product with animation effects and mobile version, enable clients to get all the information from main page and to make an order from any page. Focus on main service is Magic Bubble Show.<br>

So main page includes description of all services with prices, posibility to choose convenient package of services,
easy way to send quick message to check availability of artists, observe Gallery of pictures and Video, Review block from happy clients, plus useful Question & Answer block.
