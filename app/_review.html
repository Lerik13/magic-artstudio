							Thank you sooooo very much for coming to celebrate my daughter&apos;s birthday with
							us!
							Honestly, it far
							exceeded my expectations! The Bubble show is MA-GI-CAL!!! You transformed our
							basement
							into an enchanted
							bubble world of rainbow lights and vibrant music where everyone- over 20 kids and
							parents-was captivated
							by your superpower of making fiery bubbles!! It&apos;a great performance worth a
							professional stage, and
							right here in my own basement! This is a great way to celebrate a special event at
							home
							when you get a
							whole package from the professional performance and engaging tricks with kids to
							balloon
							twisting and
							surprise balloon penada! And last but not the least- the basement stayed all dry and
							clean AND it smelt
							like heaven for days!! I highly recommend parents to give this gift of fun to their
							child!

							We booked a bubble show with Magic Art Studio and will be booking with them again.
							They
							handled a large
							group of young children very well and that&apos;s a tough crowd to entertain! It was
							easy to book and
							the price was reasonable. Can&apos;t wait to book them again soon!

							It was just ... wow! What an amazing party our kids had today! We were so lucky to
							have
							Magic Art Studio
							to help us to celebrate our son&apos;s birthday! It was so well thought trough, no
							one
							minute the kids
							spent without doing something. The bubble show is a MUST-HAVE at any party as not
							only
							kids but even
							adults were entertained! We for sure will have another party organized with the help
							of
							this Studio.
							Highly recommend it!
